        <p class="words">Dear Tresor, <br>
            <br>
            I've been thinking about windows lately,<br>
            Half opened ones,<br>
            And how they let in just a little bit air,<br>
            Just enough to give your soul space to think,<br>
            Almost as if we let our thoughts gently be taken by the wind,<br>
            Some are too heavy and keep us grounded,<br>
            Others just needed time to let of us go,<br>
            They thought they'd be alone in the ether,<br>
            But then in a moment they know that a world of forgotten daydreams will meet them,<br>
            The wind teaches as it reaches them,<br>
            And I can't help but wonder as the thunder you rode under came near,<br>
            What wind kind of wind brought you here? <br>
            <br>
            I imagine at times God sees leaves blow and find new homes,<br>
            And with one exhale tells new dreams where to go,<br>
            He does the same with kindred souls,<br>
            Like Elisha and Elijah harmonizing tones,<br>
            I was told,<br>
            These truths can be found in tomes unbound by those chosen with hieroglyphs carved onto their bones,<br>
            This has always been more,<br>
            More than I ever bargained, begged and wished for,<br>
            Even If every daydream could conspire with the moon and the shores,<br>
            I'd never imagine that waves would come my way and lead to what had God in store, <br>
            <br>
            You are the brother,<br>
            The son,<br>
            The man I told God the world needed,<br>
            Before I met you I heard you,<br>
            In a prayer I prayed,<br>
            In some promises I was afraid to say,<br>
            Before I could let them go,<br>
            They came true,<br>
            And formed on the day at the Alex when I met you. <br>
            <br>
            Dear Tresor, <br>
            <br>
            The day I met you,<br>
            Was the first day I opened my heart to healing <br>
            This event unrelated to meeting you,<br>
            But there was something in the air that day,<br>
            I wonder was it the winds that brought you there,<br>
            Do you carry these winds in your breath? <br>
            <br>
            What kind of goodness so promised to me at that point of intersection,<br>
            Time traveled so purely to meet us here,<br>
            My brother ,<br>
            Who God knew before creation itself,<br>
            Woven like an answered prayer,<br>
            Spoken into existence like the Declaration of light, <br>
            <br>
            Let ,<br>
            There,<br>
            Be,<br>
            A rising of young men who carry the winds of God within their breaths of life to dry bones,<br>
            Let There Be hands committed to pulling faith out of the waters of those too afraid to walk on it, <br>
            Let There Be those who believe that 'hope' is not just the thing with feathers,<br>
            But that it is the winged bird that remains in every season,<br>
            There are no Summers better than right here, <br>
            <br>
            And you appear,<br>
            And God said it is good.</p>
